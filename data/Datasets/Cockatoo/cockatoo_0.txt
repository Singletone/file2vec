The Sulphur-crested Cockatoo is probably Australia's best known parrot. These birds are often kept as pets, as they are extremely intelligent and are very good at learning to talk. Be warned though - they can be very loud, mischievous and live for more than 70 years. If you don't have the time to spend with these wonderful birds, they are not the pet for you. Widely distributed through most types of open timbered country throughout northern, eastern and southwestern mainland. Mid-morning the cockatoos usually feed on seeds on the ground, then during the hottest part of the day they sit in trees near the feeding area, stripping the leaves and bark. In the afternoon they feed again and then fly back to their roosting trees for the night. Each day they return to feed in the same area until the food supply is exhausted. They eat the seeds of grasses and herbaceous plants, grains, bulbous roots, berries, nuts and leaf buds. Sulphur-crested Cockatoos nest in hollow limbs or holes high up in Eucalypts near water. They breed between August and January in the South and March to September in the North.
