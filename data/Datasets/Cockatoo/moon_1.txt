Look up in the night sky. On a clear night, if you're lucky, you'll catch a glimpse of the Moon shining in all it's glory. As Earth's only satellite, the Moon has orbited our planet for over three and a half billion years. Tere has never been a time when human beings haven't been able to look up at the sky and see the Moon looking back at them. As a result, it has played a vital role in the mythological and astrological traditions of every human culture. A number of cultures saw it as a deity while others believed that its movements could help them to predict omens. But it is only in modern times that the true nature and origins of the Moon, not to mention the influence it has on planet Earth, have come to be understood. With a mean radius of 1737 km and a mass of 73477 kg, the Moon is 0273 times the size of Earth and 0.0123 as massive. Its size, relative to Earth, makes it quite large for a satellite second only to Charon's size relative to Pluto. With a mean density of 33464, it is 0606 times as dense as Earth, making it the second densest moon in our Solar System (after Io). Last, it has a surface gravity equivalent to 12, which is 01654 times, or 17, the Earth standard. The Moon's orbit has a minor eccentricity of 00549, and orbits our planet at a distance of between 356400-370400 km at perigee and 404000 406700 km at apogee. This gives it an average distance (semi-major axis) of 384399 km, or 00257 AU. The Moon has an orbital period of 27321582 days, and is tidally-locked with our planet, which means the same face is always pointed towards Earth. Much like Earth, the Moon has a differentiated structure that includes an inner core, an outer core, a mantle, and a crust. It's core is a solid iron-rich sphere that measures 240 km (150 mi) across, and it surrounded by a outer core that is primarily made of liquid iron and which has a radius of roughly 300 km (190 mi). Around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 km (310 mi). This structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the Moon' formation 4.5 billion years ago. Crystallization of this magma ocean would have created a mantle rich in magnesium and iron nearer to the top, with minerals like olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene sinking lower. The mantle is also composed of igneous rock that is rich in magnesium and iron, and geochemical mapping has indicated that the mantle is more iron rich than Earth's own mantle. The surrounding crust is estimated to be 50 km thick on average, and is also composed of igneous rock. The Moon is the second densest satellite in the Solar System after Io. However, the inner core of the Moon is small, at around 20% of its total radius. Its composition is not well constrained, but it is probably a metallic iron alloy with a small amount of sulfur and nickel and analyses of the Moon's time-variable rotation indicate that it is at least partly molten.
